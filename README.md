# 100 days of Python

Just 100 days of me tackling on mini python problems and projects to improve my python skills!

## Installation

1. Install latest python version
2. Some directories will have their respective `requirements.txt`. You can install the required packages in order to run certain programs by running the following commands in the terminal
   1. On Windows type: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
   2. On MacOS type: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## How to run it from the terminal

1. Use `python file_name.py`
2. If it is using flask, you can choose to use `flask run`
